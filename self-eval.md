# Self Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
It felt pretty good! These challenges required a lot of trial and error. It was a really good way to get more comfortable with the material.


- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
My workflow is pretty good! I think when I get frustrated and stuck I need to take a break a little sooner.

- What do you need to do to be ready for intense technical lessons and challenges like this, for 6 hours/day next week? What support do you need?
Probably just keep practicing!
